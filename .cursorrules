// Processing to p5.js WEBGL Mode Conversion Rules

1. Coordinate System Differences:
   - Processing: Origin (0,0) at top-left, +Y goes down
   - p5.js WEBGL: Origin (0,0) at center, +Y goes up
   
2. Translation Adjustments:
   - When converting translate(width/2, height/2, z) from Processing:
     - In p5.js WEBGL: Use translate(0, 0, z) since origin is already centered
     - If patterns appear too low, use translate(0, -height * 0.3, z) to move camera up

3. Camera/View Setup:
   - Processing's coordinate system is more intuitive for top-down views
   - p5.js WEBGL may need Y-axis adjustments to match Processing's output
   - Keep rotations (rotateX, rotateZ) the same as they work consistently

4. Common Fixes:
   - If patterns appear at bottom: Adjust Y translation up
   - If patterns are inverted: Check Y-axis calculations
   - If patterns are off-center: Remember WEBGL mode auto-centers the origin
